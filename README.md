# ML-CDS: A Machine Learning-Based Cardiac Damage Score for Aortic Stenosis

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://[INSERISCI-QUI-IL-TUO-URL-STREAMLIT])

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **ML-CDS (Machine Learning-Based Cardiac Damage Score)**, an interactive web application designed for the prognostic assessment of patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis.

The tool implements a supervised machine learning model (XGBoost) trained on a comprehensive set of clinical and multi-chamber echocardiographic data. Unlike traditional categorical staging systems, the ML-CDS provides a **continuous, personalized risk score**, offering a more granular and accurate stratification of patient risk.

This application is intended as a companion tool for the research paper:

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Personalized Risk Score**: Calculates a continuous prognostic score (`ML_CDS`) based on individual patient parameters.
-   **Risk Stratification**: Classifies the patient into one of four risk quartiles (Low, Medium-Low, Medium-High, High) based on the derivation cohort.
-   **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Generates a SHAP waterfall plot to visualize how each individual feature contributes to the final risk score, providing transparent and clinically interpretable insights.
-   **Intuitive Interface**: A user-friendly web interface, inspired by clinical calculators like EuroSCORE II, allows for easy data entry and clear visualization of results.
